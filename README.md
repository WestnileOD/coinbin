=======

A Open Source Browser Based Bitcoin Wallet.Github URL: https://github.com/WestnileOD/coinbin

This is a very lightweight and easy to use wallet for anyone. This version is a very simplified version of OutCast3k Coinbin project.
Many features were removed and mostly cosmetic work, a reduced version.

Everything loaded horrible, should splash out like a dog shitting 1,000 laxitive laced tacos.....lucky it works but 
wasted 20 hours to look like same gray prisons walls fuck it im done.
